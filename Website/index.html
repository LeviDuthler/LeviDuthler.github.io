            <p>The Sint-Pietersberg is a unique and historical site in the Netherlands, it is located near Maastricht and is next to the Meuse river. Below the location can be seen.

        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Sint-Pietersberg, located near Maastricht, is a unique limestone hill with a geological history dating back to the Late Cretaceous period. Over millions of years, deposits of marine organisms formed thick layers of limestone, later exposed by erosion from the Meuse and Jeker rivers. Human activity began during the Roman period, with limestone quarried for local construction, including Maastricht’s city walls.
            <br><br>
            Ir. D.C. van Schaik's book De Sint-Pietersberg(1938, revised 1983) gives detailed information on how these quarrying activities left behind a vast network of underground tunnels, now home to unique ecosystems and historical relics. During the World Wars, the tunnels were used for shelter and military purposes. In the 20th century, conservation efforts turned parts of the quarry into nature reserves.
            <br><br>
            The changes visualized on this page focus on the landscape alterations caused by the cement factory in more recent years. In 1926, the First Dutch Cement Industry (ENCI) was granted permission to quarry part of Sint-Pietersberg for limestone extraction. The extraction did cause some of the historical tunnels to be destroyed in the proccess. Mergel (limestone) extraction ceased in 2018, the kiln closed in 2019, and the factory shut down completely in 2020. The area is now being restructured and is open for the public.

        <h2>Geographic Change Over Time</h2>
            <p>The topography of the area has changed even in recent years due to continuous quarrying. The topography maps shown come from the base registration topography (BRT) of the cadastre, for the years 1998-2012-2018. A useful tool to explore historical maps is including the ones below is <a href="https://www.topotijdreis.nl/" target="_blank">Topotijdreis</a>. In these maps some of the changes to the area can be seen like the creation of ponds and removal of some section of the mountain. These maps give a first idea of the change in the area. The nice thing about topography maps is that they are available form periods way before arial imagery. For those interested in seeing the how the area has changed dating back further, I highly recommend exploring the Topotijdreis website.

            <p>To show changes in elevation over time elevation mesurements are needed. The Netherlands’ nationwide program "Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland" (AHN) gathers detailed elevation measurements. Started in 1997, the program continues today with the fourth dataset (AHN4). Three digital elevation models (DEMs) are currently available. This data gives us an opportunity to compare the geological changes over time. In the figure below the gives information about the years the surveys were preformed.

            <p> To get a better understanding of the extend of the elevation changes a map is presented. In this map the terrains elevations is compared with the 3 different AHN surveys availible. As you can see there has been quite some changes in the landscape, most notable one is the removal of a large part of the hill on the east side of the quarry.

            <p>Looking at 2D maps is fun and all, but you know what is even more fun... 3D maps. Below the 3 different maps are presented next to each other, from the years 1998-2012-2018. The first being the elevation map from 1998 with the topography maps from the same year. Since the year 2012 orthoimagery of the whole Netherlands is gathered and made availible on <a href="https://www.pdok.nl/" target="_blank">pdok</a>. These maps are used for as an overlay for the elevation map from 2012 and 2018 shown below. These interactive maps are made with the help of the Qgis2threejs plugin for Qgis.   </p>
