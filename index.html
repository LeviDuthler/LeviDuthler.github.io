        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Sint-Pietersberg, located near Maastricht, is a unique limestone hill with a geological history dating back to the Late Cretaceous period. Over millions of years, deposits of marine organisms formed thick layers of limestone, later exposed by erosion from the Maas and Jeker rivers. Human activity began during the Roman period, with limestone quarried for local construction, including Maastricht’s city walls.
            <br><br>
            Ir. D.C. van Schaik's book *De Sint-Pietersberg* (1938, revised 1983) gives detailed information on how these quarrying activities left behind a vast network of underground tunnels, now home to unique ecosystems and historical relics. During the World Wars, the tunnels were used for shelter and military purposes. In the 20th century, conservation efforts turned parts of the quarry into nature reserves.
            <br><br>
            The changes visualized below focus on the landscape alterations caused by the cement factory. In 1926, the First Dutch Cement Industry (ENCI) was granted permission to quarry part of Sint-Pietersberg for limestone extraction. Over the years, permits were renewed, leading to the excavation of much of the southern half. The overburden removed to reach the limestone was piled up to create the artificial peak, "Observant." Mergel extraction ceased in 2018, the kiln closed in 2019, and the factory shut down completely in 2020. The area is now being restructured.

        <p>The Netherlands’ nationwide program "Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland" (AHN) gathers detailed elevation measurements. Started in 1997, the program continues today with the fourth dataset (AHN4). Three digital elevation models (DEMs) are currently available, which form the basis for the comparisons made below.

        <p>The topography of the area has changed due to continuous quarrying. The topography data comes from the base registration topography (BRT) of the cadastre. A useful tool to explore historical maps is <a href="https://www.topotijdreis.nl/" target="_blank">Topotijdreis</a>.

        <p>Below you can see the changes in elevation caused by quarrying activities.
